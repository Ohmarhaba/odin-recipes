# odin-recipes
This project will result in a recipe website consisting of korean cuisine that I grew up eating with my family. This will be the first website I have created following The Odin Project. 
I am excited to see how this website will come about after I learn more about CSS style. I plan on using this as my own cookbook I can reference when I am cooking dinner. 
This website will teach me how to better use github to publish my work, how to set up a html website, use of ordered and unordered listing, and general heading and paragraph formats.
